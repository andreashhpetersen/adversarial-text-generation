i think my plan is better than yours .
i thought tom had a day off .
we've been together for a very long time .
i think we're being followed .
my muscles were aching and i was tired .

i had no idea what to expect .
we should've bought three bottles of wine .
even though my friend was a vegetarian , i didn't tell him that the soup had some meat in it .
i asked him to drive me home .
tom shouldn't have told mary .
your parents know where you are .
i'd like to explain everything , but i don't think we have enough time .

what do you want to talk to me about ?

i've made this trip a thousand times .
tom certainly had an interesting story to tell .
they're not my prisoners .

i've heard that story already .
it is extremely hot and humid in bali in december .
don't you recognize that man ?

the soldiers guarded the bridge .
it is likely to rain today .

nobody knows when the earthquake will occur .
life is what happens to us while we are making other plans .

he was holding a large box in his arms .
she gave me a pretty doll .
let's see how tom reacts to that .
tell tom he has to do everything mary asks him to do .

i serve no one .
the pain started last night .
he's not the same man he used to be .

the exhibition was very impressive .
there is an urgent need for people to help clean up the environment .

being very tired , i soon fell asleep .
what a weird idea !

she is expecting a baby in june .
don't rely too much on others .
i'm right , aren't i ?
i'd like you to meet my wife .
she likes him .

i've tried everything i know of .
i know what you're thinking .
i'll be working .
he carries a bag on his back .
is there a bank near here ?
tom and mary got back together after a trial separation .
the cat caught a mouse .
when did this come about ?
the students made her life happy .
i hope you have a good time !
those are the leftovers from lunch .
this sentence needs to be checked by a native speaker .
you can't take it with you .
i don't have enough money to advertise .
once outside , i gave a deep sigh of relief .
tom's rather busy just now .
i need a little help here .
that was awesome .
at the party , one of his political opponents humiliated him in the presence of many guests .
i did that once .
i could see nothing but fog .
i'll fix a drink .
i'm pleased with my new jacket .
he seldom reads an editorial and is not a book worm .
she married him .
this shirt needs to be washed .
he was too tired to walk any more .
tom told mary he was busy .
does tom want something ?
i think you should get it .
cookie is a good name for a dog .
it's cold around here .
i can do a lot of things .
there's a man with a gun in his hand standing at the door .
come on , grow up .
my vision is getting worse these days .
that doesn't mean i can stay .
are you a wizard ?
i told tom we were friends .
i write every chance i get .
i need some time to think about it .
she will be here before long .
perhaps you are mistaken .
it is going to rain .
the bridge couldn't sustain the force of the strong current and collapsed .
the assignment took me longer than i had expected .
i think that's very clear .
we're not done yet .
everyone was surprised .
she refuses to say more about it .
dozens of letters are awaiting you .
i usually shower at night .
i'd rather die than leave .
i think you're nuts .
i'd like some more bread , please .
please choose a more secure password .
i can manage .
in any case , it's none of your business .
i talked with her for an hour .
tom had mary's undivided attention .
the statue has no head .
my heart skipped a beat when my wife told me she was pregnant .
i don't think i can do anything .
i want to make her happy .
money doesn't grow on trees , you know .
he started to cry .
at the start of every weekend , i am both tired and happy .
no matter who comes , don't open the door .
i found a place to live .
i can't believe that didn't work .
they signed the peace treaty .
a police officer told me to stop the car .
that's all i knew .
i can't see the movie .
this is fine .
he never laughs at my jokes .
does the room have air conditioning ?
i went into partnership with him .
i think i can .
he wakes up early .
are you looking for someone ?
was there something you wanted to tell me ?
it's my brother's .
the climate of canada is cooler than that of japan .
i do not like him either .
i seem to be lost .
i'm not so sure .
everybody likes him .
no one voted against it .
i'm all packed and ready to go .
that's not what i'm here for .
that's all over now .
they were drinking dry white wine .
i can't stop thinking about that .
i usually do the dishes .
she never reads .
i borrowed this book from him .
how is your new job working out ?
it's not my concern .
every morning she gets up early because she has to cook .
she may be a nurse .
my sister's going to kill me .
i don't have change .
tom dried his hands with a small towel .
tom is quitting .
do you still believe that ?
how many people can do that ?
i watched tv for two hours yesterday .
do you talk to your cats ?
i'm going to be a teacher .
my watch loses three minutes a day .
he gave in .
it was obviously a joke .
i saw them walking arm in arm .
i forgot my pen .
tom brought that .
my boss isn't satisfied with my report .
i agree with you on this point .
she's a single mother of two .
someone is standing behind the wall .
i'll keep this for future use .
he seemed unconscious of my presence .
i think that i was followed by someone .
the bakery is located next to the butcher shop .
i couldn't help but laugh .
now it's time to make amends .
i really like him !
give me a day or two .
his speech impressed us very much .
tom fainted at the sight of the needle .
my mother does not speak english .
she has been dating him for about two years .
i thought i was alone here .
i can't imagine such a life .
the cat scared me .
i think we were lucky .
you're on the right track .
press this button to start the machine .
the doctor gave it to her .
there's something i wanted to give you .
had i known your telephone number , i would have called you .
what were you thinking ?
maybe he likes you , too .
i will not be busy tomorrow .
this milk tastes odd .
i didn't move .
that is a blue house .
i was caught in a traffic jam .
we're going to be late again .
the lion is the king of the beasts .
when i was in school , i really hated writing essays .
we meet once a month .
she helped the old man across the street .
i like to dream .
i don't need it back .
it was all your imagination .
you don't want to be late for practice .
modern cats don't eat mice .
stand up , please .
i don't need crutches anymore .
keep on trying .
let's go out to eat .
you should always tell the truth .
i've never taught anyone anything .
tom will be back home soon .
this is how it happened .
tell me what you did on your holidays .
who's to say which is better ?
i'm willing to take care of your children , if you want me to .
you're probably right .
tom is too young to go to school .
i will not be defeated .
the world is changing more and more quickly .
he earns a great deal .
tom has a big nose .
he isn't as old as my brother .
i'm still your friend .
what do i need to know ?
you should have kept your mouth shut .
cut it in half .
you are responsible for what you have done .
she achieved remarkable results .
are you falling in love with me ?
he said something to my friend .
you remind me of your brother .
i didn't think it was a problem .
please bring me a cup of tea .
i gave most of my money away .
i lost no time in doing it .
nothing can prevent her from marrying him .
he taught me how to write a poem .
get on the horse .
we're as hungry as wolves .
i hardly ever go to museums .
is that really all there is ?
i think we have a problem .
tom has red hair .
i'm thinking of having dinner at 5 .
we must conform to the rules .
how are you connected ?
that's all it takes sometimes .
where can i leave my bike ?
like it or not , you must do it .
it took her a long time to choose a hat .
you can't leave until you've said goodbye to tom .
didn't you hear the voice in the next room ?
was i polite enough ?
this is an important event .
i'd like to see that .
i can hardly make out what he says .
i will do it right now .
i didn't do what i was told to do .
i think it's unlikely that the next model will be any better than this one .
he's a university student .
she usually gets up early .
only one man survived .
do you prefer tea or coffee ?
i've been looking forward to meeting you .
i was very confident .
i guess i just like making people happy .
i'm just not cut out for this kind of work .
could you speak as slowly as possible ?
eventually , tom found out what had happened .
there's my team .
i fell in love .
he is now on his own .
my sister will get married early next year .
we demanded that she should make up for the loss .
this is all very confusing .
are you kids hungry ?
please put on your shoes .
i'm surprised to see you here .
you're in danger , tom .
were you busy yesterday ?
i already gave you half .
since it's very cold , we can skate .
tom and mary think they know everything .
i don't know where my french textbook is .
they asserted that it was true .
our class has twenty-five boys and twenty girls .
the japanese economy developed rapidly .
i know you're not scared .
do you really think it's bad ?
tom , it's not your fault .
where's your daughter ?
don't tell me what to do .
tom doesn't like poker at all .
tom used to be my boyfriend .
i have so many things i want you to know .
i am in a spot .
i knew too much .
the number of people suffering from heart disease has increased .
i can't forget her .
he's nervous and gets scared easily .
i live pretty close to here .
try to make it last a little longer .
he became famous throughout the world .
you should relax a bit .
you should have seen it .
can you show me ?
i want to write all of this down .
i wanted to have a beer with you .
they don't know my name .
i told her not to be late .
it's none of my business !
i have immunity .
it's no laughing matter .
he felt his heart beating fast .
can you speak french ?
i know better than to be believe such a rumor .
go to the store .
i can trace my ancestors back 200 years .
she earns more than she spends .
is it complicated ?
he lived there all by himself .
i need glue .
i wonder if he likes me .
marriages are made in heaven .
what are you wearing tonight ?
how many people were present at the meeting ?
i thought of you immediately .
i want these people out of here .
she grew up to be a famous doctor .
he is , indeed , a man of his word .
she was livid when she found out all the lies he'd told her .
did tom say why he was fired ?
his behavior was anything but polite .
tom plays in a band .
i like busy places .
my back still hurts .
that's not how it happened .
is tom a good kisser ?
i think we should celebrate .
i can't do it justice .
i think you might have a drinking problem .
she looked puzzled at the abrupt question posed by a reporter .
aren't there any risks ?
she wished she had been born twenty years earlier .
drink some tea .
it's not polite to stare at others .
i never read the book .
he kindly answered the question .
i watched tv this morning .
i gave the boy what little money i had .
i asked him about the accident .
i'm headed back into town .
your coat is very beautiful .
they painted the fence green .
i'm not afraid to be criticized .
why don't you sit right there on the couch ?
tom gave mary all the money he had .
may i take your coat ?
i don't really have a choice .
it's not my birthday .
i trust him completely .
he should be put in prison .
an article about our school appeared in the newspaper .
tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
mozart wrote brilliant , complex musical compositions as easily as you or i would write a letter .
get me the details .
our school is 80 years old .
i made plans .
i think it's time for me to buy my son a car .
drop me a line when you get there .
our french teacher gives us a test every monday .
they know the truth .
what have you been up to lately ?
the bank was run by private citizens .
teachers often buy school supplies with their own money .
i can't open this jar .
many paintings hang in the shop .
is there any place around here where i can rent a bicycle ?
she scared the cat away .
you're not bruised .
i hate when other people make me wait a long time .
what is that thing in your right hand ?
i want you to have a job that you love .
what a big eater !
not everyone who lives here is rich .
push the red button if something strange happens .
he seems kind .
can we reschedule ?
do you think i'm ugly ?
we have a lot of time .
you are drunk !
he's out now .
before we say goodbye , there's something i'd like to ask you .
why give them anything ?
we have no options but to continue .
i'd never seen tom cry before .
that shirt doesn't go with the pants .
i can't hear you well .
we hope to reach the summit before it gets dark .
russian is very difficult to learn .
this is not funny .
is there anything that i should not eat ?
it's just a matter of time .
go say goodbye to them before they leave .
i want to go there .
it's good training .
i can't find it .
could you pass me the salt , please ?
i didn't mean to eavesdrop on your conversation .
that's just nonsense .
i want to go to school in australia .
you're speaking a little too fast for me .
i don't like the way he talks .
he cooked me dinner .
i want to make a good first impression .
the doctor persuaded him to give up smoking .
i asked my mother what to bring there .
he disappeared in the crowd .
he ran toward me as fast as he could .
i didn't volunteer .
he's a grown man .
i'll see you again this afternoon .
all you have to do is push this button .

she didn't say a word to me all night .
he writes to me less and less often these days .
did you kiss anybody ?
i'm very impressed by your work .
show me a better one .
i don't even have a girlfriend .
don't look down on him just because he's poor .
he tried to attract her attention .
i was talking on the phone and didn't notice the time .
her voice trembled with rage .
it seems that he's happy .
you won't drown if you learn how to swim .
children usually get up early on christmas .

all i want is money .
please telephone him .
we do not forget .

i will explain it to her .
there's no toilet paper .
tom's not a nice guy .
is there life on mars ?
it was impossible for the boy to swim across that river .
may i see your invitation please ?
he negotiated a free trade agreement with canada .
had she known the results , she would have been shocked .
the earth is similar to an orange in shape .
i was told to wait for a while .
she thought of a good way to make money on the internet .
she repulses him .
i don't recommend eating in that restaurant .
tom will be here any minute now .
tom spent three years behind bars .
i'd like to look like tom .
can i get my phone back ?
you don't need to take your shoes off .
she danced with joy .
she naturally accepted the invitation .
i was happy there .
tom never knew his parents .
may i see your passport ?
this may be your last chance .
when you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth .
i stayed up till late at night .
even though he was tired , he went on with his work .
he has broken the record .
i've got a good reason not to like tom .
i'd rather not do it .
he came down to breakfast .
he was ready to face his fate .
take that back .
a fire broke out after the earthquake .
so difficult was the question that no one could answer .
this investment is the opportunity of a lifetime .
i have nothing to do today .
you're the last hope for humanity .
wait for me in the car .
let me help you clear the table .
i haven't even unpacked my suitcases yet .
your pronunciation is more or less correct .
she hit the ball hard .
that's the part i liked best .
every nation has its own myths .

all i know is that she left last week .
can you help her out before they catch her ?
i really want to speak english fluently .
i think you should change your eating habits .
he did not like children .
where did you have your suit made ?

do you have bread for lunch ?
i replied that i didn't have parents any more .

the number of people who go abroad has been increasing .
i won't accept that .

if you go near a camel , you risk being bitten .
a man's worth lies in what he is rather than what he has .
i'm not complaining .
i'm not flexible enough to sit in the lotus position .
that ended better than i expected .
don't intrude on her privacy .
it's my fault , not yours .

we're a little busy here .
i am married and have two children .
if you feed your dog properly , you can increase his lifespan .
our team is gaining ground .

when he came , i was writing a letter .
illness prevented me from coming to school .
the politician tried to cover up the insider trading .
would that be convenient for you ?

i understand how much you want to go to the party , but i can't let you go .
if you have questions , don't hesitate to jump in .
he runs a lot of hotels .
aren't you pushing it too far ?
he did the work on his own .
they basked in the sun .
she told us not to make a noise .
he may have missed the train .
is there anything else you want to know ?
he doesn't watch television at all .
this is dangerous territory .
this hotel is better than that hotel .
he began to work to get congress to reduce taxes .
the animal struggled to get out of the cage .
come on , answer quickly .
i don't remember saying anything .
i am not quite sure if we can meet your requirements .
you could hear a pin drop .
let's stop at the first rest area we see .
see to it that this problem gets fixed by tomorrow .
the rumor was not based on facts .
i'll make this up to you .
he thanked her for her kind help .
is that not enough ?
tom was alive .
i'm looking forward to seeing him .
why should you be surprised ?
i didn't think you'd come back .
a fat white cat sat on a wall and watched them with sleepy eyes .

i will get in touch with you .
i need some water .
he is always forgetting things .

she could always call her parents when she was in a crunch .
i really miss you a lot .
i'm sure that is the truth .
it's a girl thing .

we prefer to stay here .
what was it that you did there ?
you should spend more time studying than you do .
tom and mary realized that they weren't really compatible .

i'm an american citizen .
tom was startled by a knock on the door .
tom stopped it .

i'm not ashamed .
that's good , isn't it ?
have you asked if they want one ?
when will you be back ?
i can't take my glasses off .
look at that dog .
i'd like to study in china to improve the level of my chinese .

she had a good time talking with him .
it would be great if you could join us for dinner .
you should visit kyoto .
i must've forgotten .
i'm afraid we won't be able to help you tomorrow .

this is not a good sign .
why do you want to be alone all the time ?
i want to bring my family here .
i'm a very lucky man .
have you learned the poem by heart ?
you should apologize to tom for being late .
it's sometimes difficult to control our feelings .
does the end justify the means ?
don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs .
i have to tell her that the phone rang while she was gone .
i've been waiting all night .
i've been badly bitten by mosquitoes .
are you seeing anybody now ?
i don't really care .
everyone suddenly burst into laughter .
tom wouldn't really do that , would he ?
i swear to you i will never do it again .
hand it to me .
we don't live in a perfect world .
i just couldn't keep my eyes open .
i guess i could give it a shot .
things can't be all that bad .
it's hard for me to express ideas through words .
are those your books ?

if he comes , tell him to wait for me .
i forgot my glasses somewhere .
tom never told me he was married .
i never really wanted to do that .
why don't you shut up ?
both his father and mother are dead .
i will be pleased to help you .
tom put the envelope on the table .
this song reminds me of someone i used to know .
the talks will deal with the problem of pollution .
take your time .
never choose a vocation just because your friends are in it , nor refuse another just because your worst enemy is in it .
i'm sure tom was involved .
he gave her a box .
i'm still undecided .
he was not a good politician .
we can rely on his judgement .
he was very tall , so i recognized him at once .
did you go to the last class ?
as far as i know , that never happened .
compare the two carefully , and you will see the difference .
she lost her temper and shouted at me .
it took him a long time to take in what she was saying .
i don't have anyone to yell at .
i don't need them anymore .
the wind is howling .
he will be delighted to see you .
i'm the one that pays all the bills .
i'd like to get an early start .
he can't do it .
we didn't intend to attack him .
tom drank lemonade .
the weather was perfect yesterday .
don't run so fast .
you will never be too old to learn .
the cattle starved to death .
i can't find the right words .

can't this boat go any faster ?
i thought we were going to win .
why is he doing this ?

i felt like going out for a walk .
you should take advantage of this opportunity .
this is not disneyland .
nobody likes that guy .
i will write to you soon .
am i waiting in the wrong place ?
save up so that you can go to college .
there's almost no water in the bucket .
tom certainly gives the impression that he doesn't know what he's doing .
i don't want to have kids , and i don't want to get married .
i'm here to serve you .
there is no sugar here .
tom went home at 6:30 .
tom likes watching tv .
i'll keep my eyes shut .
are you good at tennis ?
how many people do you know well ?
get the box .
the ball rolled across the road .
tom is in the living room .
i don't know exactly when i'll be back .
how come you didn't say anything ?
what's your maiden name ?
he studied the way birds fly .
i am your friend , right ?
he wiped the sweat from his brow .
we share the housework .
that , of course , does not mean that they are right .
tell tom what you want to do .
the cat is on the roof .
please think about the problem .
i got her to wash dishes .
it would be better if you didn't eat before going to bed .
does she like oranges ?
nobody knows it but me .
you better hurry .
if you could do it , would you do it ?
he seems interested in me .
i'm here to help you .
that sounded like a gunshot .
i'm not frightened of ghosts .
tom hated his mother .
i cut down a cherry tree .
mary wore a simple white dress .
the planes flew over the village .
he was elected to the senate in the last election .
none of them is alive .
recently , there have been signs that the economy is picking up steam .

this house is very good .
if you would like to have further information , please contact me .
each student has a locker .
smoking is harmful to the health .
please let me try it again .
where is the logic in that ?
there is little time left .

you can go if you want to .
some people are reading some magazines on the train .
he's acting on his own .
i have a date .
the dog is theirs .
i should quit .
it has to be done .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
there aren't as many trains at night .
he will wait .
tom was extremely impolite .
his birthday falls on sunday .
i want something to write on .
it's too dark to play tennis now .
i was very satisfied with this .
my shoes are too small .
let's not overreact .

that's exactly what i expect .
italo calvino returned to italy when he was still a child .
he has two beautiful boys .

tom likes watching tv in the evening .
the cruel man beat the dog with a whip .
she sat next to him and listened quietly .
you're not normal .
i don't see any problem .
you really have an ear for music .
he probably forgot about it .
i don't think we were followed .
this is a real popular item .
it's our only hope .
you need to stop ignoring email messages from tom .
where do we go after we die ?
i wanted to rent a bus .
i didn't graduate .
that's a filthy job and i don't want to do it .
where they burn books , they will eventually burn people .
i'd like to take this with me .
i couldn't possibly eat another bite .
make your move .
people shouldn't stare at foreigners .
you are old enough to make your own living .
this is required .
that house is haunted .
tom worked overtime .
england established many colonies .
that wasn't what tom meant .
that's all we needed .
the bear was eating an apple .
mary is tom's cousin .
please don't be sad any more .
they admired the fine view from the hill .
they stayed at a luxury hotel .
she was pleased with the new dress .
not knowing what to say , i kept silent .
i don't know what's the matter with me .
she ran to shinjuku .
she put some of the ointment on her hands .

this diamond is fake .
i don't think about you .
she insisted that he play the piano .
tom didn't see that one coming .
bring me a glass of water , please .
she's nice to me .
it was all wrong .
you've got to stop this now .
the police are looking into it .

it is wrong to cheat at cards .
i've got as much money as he has .
turn off the tv .
i have no idea of what to expect .

it's very dangerous .
i'll do it now .
the boys have gone north .
she can speak three languages .

i'm a little bit tired .
tom isn't ashamed of what he did .
it isn't over yet .
he is much older than he looks .

you're the pro .
you have to do it by yourself .
i can't describe how i felt .
i won't disappoint you .
that's open to debate .
their plan sounds interesting to me .
why don't you start by telling us how you feel ?
he's the one who told me about that .
we know this song .
i know he's the one who did it .

i'd help if i could .
i refuse to answer that .

he felt himself lifted up .
a part of this land is mine .
tom shaved off his mustache .
tom doesn't want you to share this information with anyone .
please pour me a little tea .
the soldier groaned with pain .
i can't understand what he is trying to say .
please bring us two cups of coffee .
that building is our school .

i wish you had not told the story to my mother .
tom wished mary good luck .
he was not able to marry her .
i couldn't let you take all the blame .

what does everyone do after school ?
i have a friend coming over to visit tomorrow .
would you mind closing the door ?
i'm honored to be here .
i don't care how long it takes .
she wanted to help them .
don't you care what happens ?
tom could probably tell us why .
let me smell your breath .
i guess that goes without saying , doesn't it ?
come on up here .
my legs are fine .
is he going to help us ?

is it to go ?
is that enough ?
you're really a hard worker .
you are not japanese .

we must punish him severely .
i usually eat lunch at 11:30 to avoid the rush .

outside the school , she saw people with no homes living in cardboard boxes .
a gentle wind is blowing .
i think we should hire tom .

tom said that he was busy .
i saw them kissing .
you're old enough to know better .
i'll work hard .
tom doesn't like the color of the walls in his bedroom .
we'll talk about that soon .
my mom walked into my room .
what did you want to see me about ?
that made me laugh .
he has the backing of a certain politician .
your idea is similar to mine .
i like the color green .
he is a quiet man .
what's your favorite subject ?
i'm going to be away a long time .
it's getting light .

i feel like i'm going to be lucky tonight .
mary cut herself while she was chopping up onions .
we tied him up so that he wouldn't be able to escape .
i want to do it right .
they seemed to be discussing a matter of great importance .
somebody poisoned tom .
words cannot convey my feelings .
how did you become involved in this project ?
why is he so quiet ?
do you feel like going swimming ?
i guess i'm just a little sleepy .
i'm looking for an old man .
in any case , it's always my fault .
i cannot feel at home in such a hotel .
i went to drink a beer with friends .
nothing is worse than war .
i have a lot of homework .
i don't want your legal advice .
i shouldn't have stayed up all night .
i don't agree with your methods at all .
you're not helping much .
i can teach you how to drive .
tom didn't even have the courtesy to say that he was sorry .
i don't want tom to see me like this .
the light has turned green .
no one will vote for the budget .

i want to help you , tom .
i'm very busy so don't count on me .
london is on the thames .
the weather had been hot .
keep these rules in mind .
it's your turn .

we have more pressing things to discuss .
the phone was off the hook .
six people applied for the job , but none of them were employed .

a rabbit has long ears and a short tail .
i feel like taking a bath now .
what mileage do you get with this car ?
writing is easy .
how is life ?
i love your dress .
the flimsy stalls in this restroom offer very little privacy .
he gave me his stamp of approval .
how much do i owe you ?
they were all hysterical .
put your hat back on .
it's a little late for that now .
i'm going to need some more time .
tom shaved off his beard and dyed his hair blonde , hoping people wouldn't recognize him .
how can you eat at a time like this ?
what's the point of not eating ?
do you ever sleep ?
i'm not going to call tom .
maybe he'll come tomorrow .
you have the same camera as mine .
this is a fact .
why would anyone want to kill me ?
we were held up for two hours on account of an accident .
he is supposed to be at home today .
she was having a hard time swimming .
i can't believe that you really sold that junk for such a high price .
he is proud of his collection .
everyone looked puzzled .
it sounds like someone is crying .
we have to split .
he took advantage of the opportunity .
this is my brother .
i've never had problems before .
i want time instead of money .
where will we meet ?
tom is eager to talk to mary .
don't you have anything smaller than this ?
i teach french .
she was buried in her hometown .
i met my friends yesterday .
what do i have to do now that i'm registered ?
obviously , tom didn't want to go .
i want to look like her .
is there a youth hostel near here ?
i bought this book at kakuzen's .
the prisoner who escaped two days ago is still at large .
i only asked if i could borrow the book .
i don't know where that came from .
how do you feel at this moment ?
i want a list of everyone in this class .
you've been injured before , haven't you ?
everyone stayed standing .
tom goes to school five days a week .
he gave a short talk .
i want a donut .
did you think about our offer ?
the boat sank in a flash .
i suddenly feel depressed .
that's probably a good idea .
she couldn't convince him to buy her a new car .
she's a real hottie .
what did she actually say ?
nobody was allowed to go out of the room .
she woke up .
where did the money come from ?
i had to decline his offer .
the sign indicates the way to go .
this is weird .
the prize won't be given to her .
we thought he was an american .
please move to the rear of the bus .
tom didn't mean it .
he hurried in order to get the bus .
don't go in my room .
where are you going to vacation this summer ?
you're very beautiful .
if you can , come with us .
i don't like your friends .
i can't take any more of this .
it's not worth much .
i had hardly reached the school when the bell rang .
i like your dog .
i don't know what tom wants to do .
we got married three years ago .
he tucked the napkin under his chin .
i'd like to go to my room .
i told you i'm not hungry .
i hate this school .
we are sold out of jeans .
i don't feel like drinking vodka .
that's all i can do .
don't you think i know my own brother ?
excuse me , but i think this is my seat .
he made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter .
i do not know anything about him .
who were you talking to ?
she was very beautiful when she was young .
he looks young .
you should stretch properly before exercising .
i suppose you want to ask me how i was able to make so much money in so little time .
how can i get rid of him ?
i'm happy to see you again .
she needed someone who would understand her .
i can't do it .
i had no alternative .
those were the days .
she got up to answer the phone .
i run every morning .
i'm taking care of it .
i was afraid of what people would think .
he often calls her names .
i'm not sure i'm ready for this .
the place is certainly worth seeing .
her book is very interesting .
she talks about paris as if she had been there many times .
an old man was resting in the shade of the tree .
he died within a few days of his hundredth birthday .
well , aren't you glad to see me ?
i thought we'd try that new restaurant down the street .
we weren't talking about you .
she graduated with honors .
this message turned out to be a little hard for me to write .
i want to go home now .
keep an eye on it .
the loneliness and drabness of working away from people are fatal to his best effort .
he made a mistake .
clean up that mess .
he speaks english a little .
i'm done watering the flowers .
he can't go without wine for even a day .
exercise is to the body what thinking is to the brain .
i think tom was looking for you .
she knows my wife .
tom promised never to do that again .
the press is interested in his private life .
tom handed mary a cup of coffee .
i've just talked to tom about that matter .
the proof is in the pudding .
what are the conditions ?
i would never have guessed that .
the thief got away with the money .
the universe was born more than 12 billion years ago .
the increase in juvenile delinquency is a serious problem .
she stays in touch with him .
i guess it's impossible for me to learn how to play the oboe .
that's a very bad idea .
he acted without thinking .
how many letters are there in the english alphabet ?
i wish i had eaten at that restaurant before it burned down .
never tell a lie !
have some coffee .
my work is almost finished .
can you check the tire pressure ?
i'm kind of busy right now , tom .
he has started acting strangely .
i want you to call off the fight .
he left the book on the table .
do you mean you don't find that odd ?
it will be ready soon .
the woman managed the drunk as if he were a child .
he was the last to leave .
i sent it to you two days ago .
i will have finished the work before you return .
i'm looking forward to it .
i can hear a cat scratching at the window .
that job gave him little gratification .
i hope that it is fine tomorrow .
how much should i feed my dog ?
he felt a sharp pain in his chest .
i cannot agree to your proposal .
not a soul was to be seen .
what should they do in this situation ?
poverty drove him to steal .
tom is a little angry at mary .
the contestants are gearing up for the final round of competition .
he gave a vague answer .
this soup needs more salt .
the work was finished before i arrived .
can i get you something ?
tom didn't want his friends to see him cry .
tom went skiing alone .
i'm feeling confused .
she sang the song with tears running down her cheeks .
you shouldn't depend on others too much .
for my part , i have no objection .
she is never on time .
the street lights went on .
they say that he's still alive .
he is a poet .
sorry , i didn't hear you .
please keep this information to yourself .
i will answer within three days .
not everything can be explained .
the middle finger is the longest .
i'll be a little late today .
everyone's someplace else .
do you have a dictionary ?
when was the last time you saw her ?
let's get started .
it's pitch black outside .
i saw her taking a walk in the park at midnight .
no one is sure how many people died .
this clock gains two minutes a day .
i'm following the guidelines .
don't change your mind .
take it easy .
i love cooking for my family .
will you take the job ?
what did you find out ?
what am i supposed to do with them ?
i heard a voice i didn't recognize .
i broke up with her .
did anyone see you on the beach ?
i've finished reading the book .
shut up , "
tom is traveling by himself .
don't respond to questions marked with an x .
i think i'd better stay here .
talk to me if you want .
how's your boy doing ?
best of luck to you .
i don't want you to think i'm nuts .
he doesn't have to know .
did anyone visit me during my absence ?
this tea is very good .
can you unjam the printer ?
where did you get the hat ?
you are in my way .
hold the rope .
i don't need a babysitter .
you are old enough to know this .
salmon lay their eggs in fresh water .
this is so stupid .
i'm friends with a lot of cops .
it is just like her to think of others before thinking of herself .
that was everything i had .
she was advised by him on that matter .
what did you do at that moment ?
i repeated what he said exactly as he had said it .
bad habits die hard .
i don't like doctors .
this fact must not be forgotten .
he went to austria for the purpose of studying music .
what is his age ?
we left together .
this is the town where he was born .
it was yesterday that he went there .
is that a no ?
one store decided to pull the controversial cd from its shelves .
as far as i am concerned , i have no objection .
we need more doctors like you .
i expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon .
he is very slow at making friends with anybody .
i'm the one who killed tom .
this is my daughter's school .
i spent my vacation at the beach .
it was hard for me to turn down his demand .
their modest income doesn't allow for many luxuries .
what are you doing tomorrow ?
i can't figure out how to open this suitcase .
are you still working for tom ?
that's what tom would do .
he has any number of books .
someday she'll have to pay for what she's done .
have you finished it ?
they lifted her above their heads .
she has a comfortable income .
i forgot to ask him .
we were all present at the meeting .
did i tell you about my party this friday ?
i worked in a post office during the summer vacation .
even if the sun were to rise in the west , i would not change my mind .
have they spotted you ?
i'm not dead yet .
i think you're an idiot .
can you go to the office by train ?
tom always walks to school when it isn't raining .
i wonder why tennis is played in mini-skirts .
i had no sooner left the house than it began to rain hard .
i appreciate your confidence .
you have no idea how important you are to me .
all is quiet .
i don't have all night .
i just don't know what to say .
i'll never work for you .
are you angry ?
we wish you a pleasant flight .
i'll try to persuade tom to help .
it may be that he will never be famous .
that plane will take off at five .
have you ever seen her ?
i hope you're not going to disappoint me .
don't touch anything without asking .
i like to help my friends .
are you seeing anyone ?
can all birds fly ?
we were children at that time .
they all have come .
this is totally worthless .
i think you really mean it .
are you a creature of habit ?
he likes taking care of the garden .
grandma is three and a half times your age .
i can't protect you .
i never dreamed of there being such a quiet place in this noisy city .

she does look tired .
tom is boring .
tom often cries when he's drunk .
the leaves are turning red .
he didn't get her joke .
that sounds awesome .
fill the tires with air .
i don't know what the big deal is .
no one uses that word anymore .
i've already read this book .
trust me on this .
french has many more vowels than japanese .
i'm only three years older than he is .
is there anyone here ?
it's right up your alley .
it is impossible for me to do so .
we want to negotiate .
tom doesn't appear to be paying attention .
i tried to save you .
don't believe what she says .
we considered it .
please pardon me for coming late .
he lives all alone in the woods .
they were not pleased .
i feel better today , but i am not well enough to work .
tell them what happened .
her skin is smooth .
you should go home now .
i think you know who i'm talking about .
give us everything you have .
tom is very difficult to get along with .
why don't you put some clothes on ?
he seems angry .
that's my suitcase .
i think you might need my help .
the little boy said hello to me .
we were just holding hands .

don't trust him .
my father works for a bank .
i'd do it again .
do you guys need a ride ?
i have something i want to say to you .
this medicine tastes horrible .
my grandmother passed away last year .
this was on the list .
which reminds me , it's been more than 30 years since that incident .
she is old enough to travel by herself .
you'll never be able to keep it a secret .
i know you want to help .
she avoided answering my questions .
he is very good-looking .
was the movie interesting ?
why are you bleeding ?
your english is improving .
i can not bear this noise any more .
i have been busy this week .
it's one of those moments .
he sang off key .
she lives a few blocks away from here .
she didn't appear to recognize me .
tom's name was on the box .
i won't let you go there .
you can save your breath .
my cat will love this .
i want you all to be on your best behavior .
it's something my mother used to do .
she was absent because she caught a cold .
she was more beautiful than all of the others .
are you out of your minds ?
those standing were all men .
do you have the book ?
i don't know what i'm supposed to do .
they don't understand me when i speak german .
you're testing my patience .
i want you to take care of tom for a little while .
i think tom knows what he's doing .
cats like playing in the sun .
as a singer , she's well known .
she got so carried away listening to the beatles that she missed the date with him .
did she sleep well ?
i don't think this is the best time to talk to tom .
may i visit you tomorrow ?
i'm glad you met tom .
may i ask you to close the window ?
it's all about technique .
even tom was surprised .
i'm not going to stop .
i'd rather be at home .
tom is in there alone .
how about taking up jogging ?
she left her children in her aunt's care .
i have just read this book .
i didn't do it for you .
i don't think it's such a bad idea .
i love that shirt .
to make matters worse , it began snowing .
he thinks that's normal .
why are people afraid of you ?
that dress fit her perfectly .

no one answered my question .
what will the weather be like tomorrow ?
my watch is ten minutes fast .
tom is better than me at math .

i found this under your bed .
make a list .
i want a raise .
i bought that book for tom .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like you to listen to my opinion .
that fact can't be denied .
there wasn't much traffic .
what are some foods you usually eat with your children ?
i think i touched a nerve .
have you seen our museums ?
he seemed to like that .
everybody wants to protect you .
she sang better than him .
that feels amazing .
he took a deep breath before entering his boss's office .
you aren't tom .
i often make mistakes .
he is not what he was .
you must go up the hill .
talk to my boss .
we can't just sit here .
it is about time i was going .
the parrot is dead .
a violent thought instantly brings violent bodily movements .
he's very understanding .
that's very nice of you to say .

it was raining when i got on the bus this morning .
you should ask a physician for his advice before taking this medicine .

tom cheated on his girlfriend for months .
her talent is amazing .
i'm not discouraged .
can you prove the allegations ?

cheese is easy to cut with a knife .
i cannot afford long vacations .

i teach here .
i am talking to my sister .
what denominations would you like that in ?
he hurried past me without stopping to speak .
you're not fired .
are you resourceful ?
who's your date tonight ?
tom doesn't really like dogs .
he found her irresistible .
i don't have any choice .
this is a book .
i used to do that as a kid .
i lost a lot of money .
this place is creepy .
you shouldn't be angry .

i think i'm drunk .
you don't need to study today .
it rained five successive days .
tom threatened mary with a knife .
do you want your old job back ?
i think the mistake is mine .

i want to do it tonight .
you have to do as i say .
the contestant made two false starts .
can you tell me how to get to the station ?
there's not enough time .
tom went to church with mary .
i always have trouble remembering names .
i guess not .
we asked him on the interphone if he could come downstairs quickly .
i don't really want to talk about this now .
where are your books ?
please stop whistling .
he'd be the last one to disappoint you .
there's someone i want you to meet .
i'm not going to tell you again .
i'd like a cup of coffee , please .
i've gotten used to this climate .
tom found a hundred dollar bill on the street .
i'll explain the matter to you later on .
mary isn't tom's wife .
i had hoped that my mother would live until i got married .
ask me something easier .
don't you pay attention ?
tomorrow , i'm going to study at the library .
his son has what it takes to be a good doctor .
there is insufficient light to take pictures .
you don't have to speak .
i don't like to be away too long .
it's a one-time offer .
what's your favorite kind of fish ?
i felt very uneasy .
you might as well go kill yourself .
i was stupid enough to believe tom .
where are you now ?
i'm catching on .
we had a very vigorous debate .
tom shouldn't have married mary .
the school is on the hill .
he isn't who he says he is .
we've still got a couple of days .
he was surprised at the long-distance phone bill .
i saw you there .
we all miss you very much .
why didn't you follow my advice ?
some medicine does us harm .
wait for tom .
i know what you know .
does this ring a bell ?
i want to show you something .
tom lost three sons in the war .
did the car look old ?
they will survive .
you've been busy , haven't you ?
is there anybody here you don't know ?
boys don't like girls who talk too much .
that's really not funny .
i found out something .
please don't cry .
don't worry about your family .
tom and i are married now .
i can't get her out of my mind .
manuela's dresses are very elegant .
i was just messing around .
speak more slowly , please !
it's not just illegal , it's also dangerous .

do you really think tom is better than i am ?
he had a lot of money in the bank .
i don't care for foreign food .
you look as healthy as ever .
he was a good friend .
tom can't swim as fast as mary .
most boys know his name .
don't be scared of making mistakes .
i may be wrong .
i need to make an appointment .
don't disturb me .
he explained it at length .
he makes it a rule never to speak ill of others .

my father is a bit old-fashioned .
i don't trust anybody .
is this all we need ?
since it's nice out , i'd like to go take a walk .
i have an ever growing list of to-do items .
i think there is no point in trying to persuade him .
you have no idea how distressed she was .
it's two miles from here to the station .
do you have anything to say in particular ?
what's the cost ?
i need to be at work by 7:30 .
i cannot help laughing at her jokes .
it's worth checking out .

i can't believe i listened to you .
i ordered the children to stay quiet , but they kept on making noise .
he won't tell me what happened .
there is a key on the desk .
i don't know how i did it .
let's leave when you are ready .
you can't prove a thing .
how did you know all that ?
all i ask is that you show up on time .

i want one !
let's go to eat together .
his son had been killed in a duel .
don't you play tennis ?
i don't think we need to do it .

is this your wine ?
he is good at solving complicated mathematical problems .
you're still young .
only a handful of people know the fact .
don't use your real name .
tom scrubbed his feet .

i was planning on it .
he was absent at roll call .

tom washes his car at least once a week .
my son can already count up to one hundred .
we were very busy last week .
is a proverb .
when did he go ?
lightning struck the tower .
they need to change their mindset .
i have to solve the problem myself .
a lot of foreigners visit japan every year .

athletes are no different .
i left my card at home .
the vaccination left a funny little mark on my arm .

the recent frequency of earthquakes makes us nervous .
i hate it when tom and mary fight .
let's quit here and continue tomorrow .

tom takes the trash out every day at six o'clock .
i can't figure out how to transfer mp3 files from my ipod back to my computer .
that's all i was waiting for .
let's not talk to her .
i haven't really made up my mind yet .
you can rest .
she whispered it in my ear .
an eagle is flying in the sky .
tom's garage is filled with things that he never uses .
a man's worth lies not in what he has but in what he is .
i mean what i say .
he probably won't become famous .
i'm the captain .
i never did like it anyway .
who were you dreaming about ?
come into my room .

tom allowed mary to leave early .
he is ashamed of his failure .
his wife seems to be a foreigner .
he has a good appetite .
i don't think anyone really expected you to help .
i know how to handle this .
i didn't know the city , and what's more , i couldn't speak a word of the language .
he's definitely not coming .
we are the best .
i got up very late this morning .
my father is too stubborn to admit his faults .
i don't want to be any more burden to my parents .

she was looking forward to playing table tennis with him .
i thought you didn't like them .
i just want to talk to them .

there's milk in the fridge .
i have bad breath .
what's the idea ?
you're in danger .
tom bought a gift for his daughter .
is there anything you want me to buy for you ?
just as we are talking , there was a loud explosion .
are you seriously thinking about selling this on ebay ?
i use this all the time .
he is angry with you .
tom doesn't know where to look .
i can't carry on like this .
i will try to live up to your expectations .
do you want to tell me what this is ?
it's unbearably hot .
i disagree with you on this .
have you ever argued with your manager ?
i suppressed a yawn .
i changed my address last month .
can i ask you a personal question ?
i'll talk to you later .
the concert is about to start .
there are plenty of rocks .
as far as i know , he won't come .
the conference ended two hours ago .

love will survive .
i don't know if i can stay .
do you want anything ?
what do you want for your birthday ?
if i remember correctly , that's the song tom sang at mary's wedding .
she was the last to cross the finishing line .
what actually happened ?
we're not mad .
you look like a tourist .
i must postpone going to the dentist .
the well ran dry .
television is ruining family life .
you should keep this machine clean and lubed .
they will have to cut down their expenses .
i get the picture .
i don't want to play golf .
what do you think they're after ?
i want to try something new .
the fruit is similar to an orange in shape and to a pineapple in taste .
just then , the telephone rang .
take a breather .
i just want to get some sleep .
i just met him .
how is that possible ?
it's convenient for me to see you at ten tonight .
i will never do it again .
this tea smells nice .
i just want people to like me .
that never should've happened .
i don't really know you .
didn't your parents teach you anything ?
what if i refuse ?
i don't need tom .
i want to go to america someday .

the water is warm .
there are seven men and four women in my section .
we could walk .
my father is a heavy smoker .
the reason tom didn't go with us was because he didn't have enough money .
she tried to conceal the fact .
tom was given a medal .
where are your things ?
if only i had a pretty dress like that !
i just want to check on something .
it's a very good newspaper , isn't it ?
how long have you been abroad ?
you haven't seen tom this morning , have you ?
these machines aren't working now .
i think that he is right .
he stared at me from head to foot .
i think we should talk about this later .
i get the picture now .
what are you up to ?
i think that might be wise .
i'm not taking any chances .
i asked him where i should park my car .
what do i want to talk about ?
only seven senators remained undecided .
a true gentleman would not betray his friends .
no one stops to listen to him .
tom has a bald spot .
just let me collect my thoughts .
tom told them not to do that .
i think i'll snooze for a while .
3 a dozen .
i thought you needed money .
i have been living in canada for almost five years .
we didn't give them a choice .
do you like studying ?
tom can't say for sure when mary will arrive .
it worked perfectly .
who could take his place ?
why are you asking so many questions ?
i knew it wouldn't work .
why don't you ever cook ?
i love you and i don't want anything bad to happen to you .
she gets along well with him .
no one can do that .
will you go there ?
i can't shake off my cold .

i must repay the debt .
i just got a little carried away .
i fall asleep easily while watching television .
she is a gifted artist .
is this your house ?
that's exactly what he said .
i think this belongs to you .
why don't you just admit that you were wrong ?
i thought you were going to fix the sink .
he's a famous artist .
you should cut up your meat before you eat it .
tom explained the problem to me .
a woman appeared from behind a tree .
i live in town .
the letter was wrongly addressed .
there's someone hiding in the closet .
please make three copies of each page .
it's like being a kid in a candy store .
i will be leaving for australia next month .
we have little chance of winning .
i'd like a little privacy .
even though i looked for it , i did not find it .
they don't really care .
you can't be too careful these days .
her derogatory remarks towards her boss caused her to lose her job .
i'm not done with you yet .
shall we go and eat ?
i didn't take your money .
they live on the floor beneath .
i'm pressing charges .
i am sure .
my association with him did not last long .
the prince asked the little girl why she was crying .
which book do you need ?
he was disappointed .
i never should've left you .
we shouldn't stay here .
he made her a bookshelf .
you can trust him .

i always pay the rent on time .
my eyes feel itchy .
he is studying in the library now .
will you please let me go now ?
have you ever ridden in a hot air balloon ?
i thought this was mine .
i realized that i didn't want to spend any more time dealing with that problem .
i'm playing with my friends .
simmer the butter and garlic in a small saucepan .
i go up to the rooftop when i want to see the blue sky .
don't worry about such a thing .
i was searching for food .
i'll come and see you later .
how old is he ?
he keeps two cats .
it was no laughing matter .
frankly speaking , i don't like you .
his bicycle is different from this one .
hikers need to carry a compass with them to find their way through the woods .
i'll need to make some more tests .
his success delighted his parents .
i'm planning to disguise myself as a doctor .
it might rain tomorrow .
i like them .
i don't understand german .
is he looking at me ?
let me deal with this .
it's clear that you're wrong .
unemployment is rising .
i've been trying to put a little money in the bank every month .
where's the nearest library ?
he is full of energy .
stop it right now !
would you like some more tea ?
it seems a cruel thing to clip a bird's wings .
i took care of it for you .
this is so boring .
are you seriously thinking about not going ?
tom seems to be an honest person .
they caught tom .
i must hurry to class .
since he has ambitions , he works hard .
he fell in love with the girl at first sight .
i wonder which one i should choose .
opportunities like this don't come along every day .
the more foolish a child is , the cuter he seems to his parents .
do you want me to lose my job ?
i arrived at the stadium at 4:00 p .
you should have been more careful .
i waited for ten minutes .
we aren't always right .
i like the way you think .
why don't we go swimming ?
she had lived in hiroshima until she was ten .

drink less and sleep more .
he's young and attractive .
tom says he thinks it's a waste of time to vote .
she bought the dress on impulse .
my father has been doing this job for twenty years .
he stressed the convenient aspects of city life .
now that you have finished your job , you are free to go home .

my foot hurts .
i took a taxi because the bus was late .
she was kissed by him .
these are the originals .
i must buy one .
mary is on maternity leave .
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .
can we get started now ?
i wouldn't think of it .
she's asking for the impossible .
i only think of you .
there is a serious problem .
he hates himself .
there was no trace of him .
nothing in the world is stronger than the will to survive .
they went on board the ship .
i did better than everyone expected .
the only language tom can speak is french .
you should think before you begin to speak .
most public places are simply not geared to people with disabilities .
we all work too hard .
i only saw him once .
i'll be around all day .
he went to see her in the hospital every other day .
she says i need a fresh start .

there is little hope that she will come on time .
you may choose any of them .
can you tell me what is happening ?
was he still here when you arrived ?
is that what tom told you ?
she was tired .
he began running .

what makes you think i won't be able to do it ?
will she go to america next year ?
may the new year bring you happiness !
deeds are better than words .

that's all i needed .
i will be sixteen next birthday .

she helped her daughter get dressed .
i visited him on sunday morning .
i know your brother very well .
i was born in 1960 .

we're very serious .
i had never seen so many squirrels in my life .
may i introduce myself to you ?
i had to wait twenty minutes for the next bus .
tom told me a good joke this morning .
lay it on the table .
don't be afraid of seeing the doctor .
ceo's of american corporations are paid several times their japanese counterparts .
he is the captain of the team .
london is the capital of england .
where do we go from here ?
don't stand up .
we left four days later .
my computer's acting up .
he nearly got away with it .
i certainly would like a refund .
there has been no rain for two weeks .
if i knew his address , i would write to him .

i'm going to do some shopping .
tom and mary weren't particularly kind to me .
i'm not armed .
this animal is very clever .
she will be here this evening .
where did you find this wallet ?
i'm not taking sides .
don't leave them alone .
that's an excellent point .
mary is the prettiest girl in her class .
what happened at the beach ?

he just cares about himself .
that wouldn't be smart .
he devoured his meal .
she patted me on the shoulder .
i have never been there myself .
